We currently have funded opportunities for PhD and MA students; see below.

Graduate students in History/Digital Humanities and History/Data Science will be trained in reproducible computational approaches and open science, as well as the necessary grounding in the antiquities trade, and the human remains subtrade. Digital training will include everything from version control to writing analytical packages, to interactive website design for tutorial-writing and outreach. They will learn state of the art machine learning and neural network approaches with social media data.

Students will be involved in the outset in planning our research design; they will have opportunities to publish as lead authors (especially with regard to mobilizing knowledge through venues such as The Programming Historian and conferences such as DHSITES). MA students will have the opportunity to work in a leadership role with students in Graham’s undergraduate digital history research methods courses (HIST3812 and HIST3814); the PhD student will have the opportunity to design and teach undergraduate courses on the intersection of data ethics and history/archaeology. The graduate students will be encouraged and supported to hold ‘unconferences’ (see [thatcamp.org](http://thatcamp.org)) on a theme of their choosing; an excellent opportunity exists for international participation and recognition of their work should they choose to hold one (as we will encourage them to do) during the DH2020 Conference in Ottawa.

Their research may include:

+ Writing code to generate datasets
+ Developing various NN
+ Analyzing results
+ Ground-truthing training datasets (making sure that training images are properly classified)
+ Curating and preparing materials for data publication in appropriate venues
+ Research and writing of tutorials
+ Research and writing connected with their own research interests as they intersect with this project
+ Communicating the results of research with relevant publics at conferences and other venues

#### Funded PhD Opportunity<br><br> 'Ethics, Digital Humanities, and the Computer Gaze'

We are seeking an individual to explore from an ethical perspective for public history and cultural heritage writ large, the use of various digital technologies broadly classified as 'AI' on photographic (or other social media) materials. This research would form an integral part of Shawn Graham and Damien Huffer's "The Bone Trade: Studying the Online Trade in Human Remains with Machine Learning and Neural Networks Project". The student would start ideally in September 2018.

The candidate's major field would be in Public History, with a breadth field in Digital Humanities

Interested candidates are invited to contact Dr. Shawn Graham to discuss their potential research project, to gauge their potential fit with the funding envelope and other potential supplementary funding sources. Candidates are also invited to review the Phd Program requirements at https://carleton.ca/history/graduate/phd-program/program-requirements/

International students are also invited to apply.

Criteria:

- a good MA degree in a relevant subject (history, archaeology, etc)
- some existing ability in digital humanities methods is desirable

#### Funded MA Opportunities <br><br> History, Public History, and Digital Humanities

We are seeking two potential MA students (to start September 2018) to collaborate on "The Bone Trade: Studying the Online Trade in Human Remains with Machine Learning and Neural Networks Project". The students would pursue their own research within the ambit of this project, which revolves around the use of various AI technologies investigating the trade in human remains online. Ideally, the students' own research projects would push the research into other domains, for instance, historical photographs; tourist photos; advertising using historical imagery, digital historical consciousness.

Interested candidates are invited to contact Dr. Shawn Graham to discuss their potential research project, to gauge their potential fit with the funding envelope and other potential supplementary funding sources. Candidates are also invited to review the MA History, MA Public History, with Collaborative Digital Humanities Program requirements -

https://carleton.ca/history/m-a-in-public-history/

Criteria:
- a good first degree in a relevant subject (history, archaeology, etc)
- existing ability in digital humanities methods or issues is desirable, but not critical. Much more important is an ability to think creatively about the problems or potentials of computational viewpoints.
