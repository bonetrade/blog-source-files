### Shawn Graham

Graham is an archaeologist who is currently Associate Professor of Digital Humanities in the History Department at [Carleton University](http://carleton.ca/history). With Ian Milligan and Scott Weingart, he is the author of ‘Exploring Historical Big Data: The ['Historian’s Macroscope’](http://themacroscope.org) (2015). He has written a number of tutorials for [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) and his research blog (e.g., 2016b) on different computational techniques for both analysis and representation of historical data. He is founder and editor of [Epoiesen: A Journal for Creative Engagement in History and Archaeology](http://epoiesen.library.carleton.cat) and is currently building the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook (or ODATE), which will serve as a living resource of how to do digital archaeology in a way that “encourages innovative, reflective, and critical use of open access data and the development of digital tools that facilitate linkages and analysis across varied digital sources”.


### Damien Huffer

His postdoctoral work  incorporates the collection of photographic and osteological data from ‘trophy skull’ assemblages (primarily Bornean Dayak and W.
